The need for reverse engineering binary software components arises in more and more contexts every day. 
Common cases include analysis of malicious software such as viruses, worms, trojans and rootkits, 
analyzing binary drivers in order to develop open source drivers for alternate platforms, 
analyzing closed source software for security flaws, and source code recovery in legacy systems. 
The first step in such an analysis is generally the acquisition of a high quality disassembly of the binary component. 
Ida Pro is touted as the premier disassembler available today, capable of disassembling machine languages for 
a large number of microprocessors and micro controllers. This course will cover advanced features of Ida that may be used to 
work through challenging reverse engineering problems. 
This course is taught using primarily x86 and ARM assembly language.

WHAT STUDENTS SHOULD BRING
Students should bring their own laptops with an installed version of Ida Starter or Ida Professional 7.0 or greater
(available for Windows, Mac, or Linux). Also required are Adobe Reader or other pdf reader, unzip utility (.zip .gz .tgz) 
and an appropriate 64-bit build environment for their version of Ida (Visual Studio C++ 2013 (or newer) for Windows, 
g++/make for Linux/Mac). Laptops should be pre-configured with a working 64-bit Python 2.7 installation. 
No guarantee is made that students attempting to complete the course using older or demo versions of Ida will be able to 
complete every exercise.
