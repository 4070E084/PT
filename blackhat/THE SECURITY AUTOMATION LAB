# THE SECURITY AUTOMATION LAB

he security industry is running fast towards security automation to increase the capability and capacity of security teams so they can effectively and efficiently stay on top of the constantly evolving threats, attacks and security breaches that occur every day!

We will take your security capabilities from "Tedius" to "Turbo" in 2 days flat! Learn how to implement streamlined security operations and optimise budgets through security automation, including:

- Automating the collection and analysis of internal and external intelligence data
- Automating targeted attacks to more frequently and efficiently identify security weaknesses and attack techniques
- Automating security testing of applications to enforce a continuous security baseline
- Automating incident response processes, data collection, analysis and response to efficiently contain security breaches
- Automating preventative and responsive controls through integration with security devices and infrastructure
- Automating the generation of real-time security visualisation dashboards, threat reports, and alerts for critical operational security team actions
- Automating the orchestration of end-to-end intelligence and security controls and analysis for immediate capability enhancements

Students are provided with their own dedicated cloud-based Security Automation environment consisting of servers and applications with a range of vulnerabilities that need protection from an onslaught of ongoing attacks and security breaches. The aim of this course is to teach students how to automate the discovery and protection of security weaknesses whilst automatically responding to incidents and gaining visibility into the areas where further security automation can be enhanced.
